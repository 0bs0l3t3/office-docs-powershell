## DESCRIPTION
Below Content Applies To: Lync Server 2010

Removing a service or server role from a computer does not automatically update the Lync Server 2010 topology.
Instead, that service or role must be disabled before the changes are fully updated in the topology.
The Disable-CsComputer cmdlet provides a way for administrators to disable any services or server roles that have been removed from the local computer.

Unless you use the Scorch parameter, the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet does not uninstall the Lync Server 2010 software; instead, it simply stops the computer from functioning in its previously assigned role.

Who can run this cmdlet: You must be a local administrator and a member of the domain in order to run the Disable-CsComputer cmdlet locally.
