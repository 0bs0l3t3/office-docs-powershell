## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
!!! Exchange Server 2010

The Identity parameter specifies the name of the policy or the path to the policy including the name, for example, \<Organization\>\\\<ResellerA\>\\\<Resellerâ€¦n\>\\\<Tenant\>\\\<Object Name\>.



!!! Exchange Server 2013

The Identity parameter specifies the name of the policy or the path to the policy including the name, for example, \<Organization\>\\\<ResellerA\>\\\<Reseller...n\>\\\<Tenant\>\\\<Object Name\>.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The Identity parameter specifies the mailbox policy that you want to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:

- Name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID

In multi-tenant environments, you can use the path to the policy including the name, for example, \<Organization\>\\\<ResellerA\>\\\<Reseller...n\>\\\<Tenant\>\\\<Policy Name\>.



```yaml
Type: MailboxPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController
!!! Exchange Server 2010

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.



!!! Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.



```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)

Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
!!! Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013

The Force parameter specifies whether to suppress the warning or confirmation messages that appear during specific configuration changes.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The Force switch specifies whether to suppress warning or confirmation messages. You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online
