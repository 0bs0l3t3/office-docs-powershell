## DESCRIPTION
!!! Exchange Server 2010

The Remove-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet removes an existing recipient from a distribution group or a mail-enabled security group. You can't use the Remove-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet to remove a recipient from a dynamic distribution group. A dynamic distribution group queries Active Directory mail-enabled objects and builds the group's membership based on the results. The group's membership is recalculated whenever an e-mail message is sent to the group.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although all parameters for this cmdlet are listed in this topic, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To see what permissions you need, see the "Distribution groups" entry in the Mailbox Permissions topic.

```yaml
Type: DistributionGroupIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck
!!! Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013

The BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck parameter specifies whether to bypass security checks and moderation for the member being added, if the specified distribution group is a moderated distribution group.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The BypassSecurityGroupManagerCheck switch specifies whether to allow a user who isn't an owner of the group to modify or delete the group. If you aren't defined in the ManagedBy property of the group, you need to use this switch in commands that modify or delete the group. To use this switch, your account requires specific permissions based on the group type:

- Distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Security Group Creation and Membership role assigned.

- Role groups: You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group or have the Role Management role assigned.

You don't need to specify a value with this switch.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
!!! Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-* and Set-* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
