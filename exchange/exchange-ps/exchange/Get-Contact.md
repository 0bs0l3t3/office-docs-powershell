This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently in the default scope. Using the IgnoreDefaultScope parameter introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

- You can't use the OrganizationalUnit and Identity parameters together.

- You can't use the Credential parameter.



!!! Exchange Server 2013

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The IgnoreDefaultScope parameter instructs the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session and use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently in the default scope. Using the IgnoreDefaultScope parameter introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.

- You can't use the OrganizationalUnit and Identity parameters together.

- You can't use the Credential parameter.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

The IgnoreDefaultScope switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope.

Using the IgnoreDefaultScope switch introduces the following restrictions:

- You can't use the DomainController parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.

- You can only use the DN for the Identity parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:

- Name

- Canonical name

- Distinguished name (DN)

- GUID



```yaml
Type: OrganizationalUnitIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadFromDomainController
!!! Exchange Server 2010

The ReadFromDomainController parameter specifies that the user information is read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you set the recipient scope to include all recipients in the forest, and if you don't use this parameter, it's possible that the user information is read from a global catalog with outdated information. If you use this parameter, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.



!!! Exchange Server 2013

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ReadFromDomainController parameter specifies that the user information is read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you set the recipient scope to include all recipients in the forest, and if you don't use this parameter, it's possible that the user information is read from a global catalog with outdated information. If you use this parameter, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The ReadFromDomainController switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the ReadFromDomainController switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the ReadFromDomainController switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch.

By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.



```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)

The RecipientTypeDetails parameter specifies the type of recipients returned. Recipient types are divided into recipient types and subtypes. Each recipient type contains all common properties for all subtypes. For example, the UserMailbox type represents a user account in Active Directory that has an associated mailbox.
