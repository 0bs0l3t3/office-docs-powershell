## DESCRIPTION
!!! Exchange Server 2010

Use the Get-AddressList cmdlet, piped to Format-List, to get the GUID, distinguished name (DN), or path and name of an existing address list. Or, use Get-AddressList to get a specific existing address list, and then pipe the output directly to Set-AddressList.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although all parameters for this cmdlet are listed in this topic, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the Mailbox Permissions topic.

!!! Exchange Server 2013

Use the Get-AddressList cmdlet, piped to Format-List, to get the GUID, distinguished name (DN), or path and name of an existing address list. Or, use Get-AddressList to get a specific existing address list, and then pipe the output directly to the Set-AddressList cmdlet.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although all parameters for this cmdlet are listed in this topic, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the Email address and address book permissions topic.

By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, Manage role groups.

!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Use the Get-AddressList cmdlet, piped to Format-List, to get the GUID, distinguished name (DN), or path and name of an existing address list. Or, use Get-AddressList to get a specific existing address list, and then pipe the output directly to the Set-AddressList cmdlet.

The Conditional parameters that are used with the IncludedRecipients parameter are subject to the following limitations:

- The EQV operator is used for every property value, as in "Department equals Sales". Wildcards and partial matches aren't supported.

- The OR operator is always used for multiple values of the same property, as in "Department equals Sales OR Marketing".

- The AND operator is always used for multiple properties, as in "Department equals Sales AND Company equals Contoso".

To create flexible filters that use any available recipient property and that aren't subject to these limitations, you can use the RecipientFilter parameter to create an OPath filter.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, Manage role groups.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2010)
```
Set-AddressList -Identity "All Users\Sales\building4" -Name building9
```

This example modifies the name of an existing address list.

### Example 1 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2013)
```
Set-AddressList -Identity "All Users\Sales\building4" -Name building9
```

### -ConditionalStateOrProvince
!!! Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013

The ConditionalStateOrProvince parameter is a filter to specify a state or province. All recipients with a ConditionalStateOrProvince attribute that matches the value that you input for this parameter are included in the address list. You can use multiple values as a comma-delimited list. You must use the IncludedRecipients parameter if you use a Conditional parameter. You can't use this parameter if you use the RecipientFilter parameter.



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The ConditionalStateOrProvince parameter specifies a filter that's based on the value of the recipient's StateOrProvince property. You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

When you use multiple values for this parameter, the OR Boolean operator is applied. For more information about how Conditional parameters work, see the Detailed Description section of this topic.

You can't use this parameter with the RecipientFilter parameter. You need to use the IncludedRecipients parameter with a Conditional parameter.



```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml

### -ForceUpgrade
!!! Exchange Server 2010

The ForceUpgrade parameter suppresses the following confirmation: "To save changes on object, the object must be upgraded to the current Exchange version. After upgrade, this object can't be managed by a previous version of Exchange System Manager. Do you want to continue to upgrade and save the object?" This confirmation occurs when you upgrade an address list that was created in Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. You can't manage an Exchange 2003 address list by using the Exchange Management Console until you update the object's version and change the recipient filter by using either the RecipientFilter or IncludedRecipients parameter.



!!! Exchange Server 2013

The ForceUpgrade switch suppresses the following confirmation: "To save changes on object, the object must be upgraded to the current Exchange version. After upgrade, this object can't be managed by a previous version of Exchange System Manager. Do you want to continue to upgrade and save the object?"



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.
