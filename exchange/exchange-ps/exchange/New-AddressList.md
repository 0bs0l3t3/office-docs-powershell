## DESCRIPTION
!!! Exchange Server 2010

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although all parameters for this cmdlet are listed in this topic, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the Mailbox Permissions topic.

!!! Exchange Server 2013

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although all parameters for this cmdlet are listed in this topic, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To see what permissions you need, see the "Address lists" entry in the Email address and address book permissions topic.

By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, Manage role groups.

!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The Conditional parameters that are used with the IncludedRecipients parameter are subject to the following limitations:

- The EQV operator is used for every property value, as in "Department equals Sales". Wildcards and partial matches aren't supported.

- The OR operator is always used for multiple values of the same property, as in "Department equals Sales OR Marketing".

- The AND operator is always used for multiple properties, as in "Department equals Sales AND Company equals Contoso".

To create flexible filters that use any available recipient property and that aren't subject to these limitations, you can use the RecipientFilter parameter to create an OPath filter.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).

By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, Manage role groups.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2010)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'MailboxUser') -and ((StateOrProvince -eq 'Washington') -or (StateOrProvince -eq 'Oregon')))}
```

This example creates the address list MyAddressList. The address list includes recipients that are mailbox users and have the StateOrProvince property set to Washington or Oregon.

### Example 1 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2013)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'MailboxUser') -and ((StateOrProvince -eq 'Washington') -or (StateOrProvince -eq 'Oregon')))}
```

This example creates the address list MyAddressList. The address list includes recipients that are mailbox users and have the StateOrProvince property set to Washington or Oregon.

This example creates the address list MyAddressList. The address list includes recipients that are mailbox users and have the StateOrProvince property set to Washington or Oregon.

### Example 2 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2010)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList2 -ConditionalStateOrProvince Washington -IncludedRecipients MailboxUsers
```

This example creates the address list MyAddressList2 that includes mailboxes that have the ConditionalStateOrProvince parameter set to Washington.

### Example 2 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2013)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList2 -ConditionalStateOrProvince Washington -IncludedRecipients MailboxUsers

### Example 2 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2016)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList2 -ConditionalStateOrProvince Washington -IncludedRecipients MailboxUsers
```

This example creates the address list MyAddressList2 that includes mailboxes that have the ConditionalStateOrProvince parameter set to Washington.

### Example 2 -------------------------- (Exchange Online)
```
New-AddressList -Name MyAddressList2 -ConditionalStateOrProvince Washington -IncludedRecipients MailboxUsers
```

This example creates the address list MyAddressList2 that includes mailboxes that have the ConditionalStateOrProvince parameter set to Washington.

### Example 3 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2010)
```
New-AddressList -Name "AL_AgencyB" -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'MailboxUser') -and (CustomAttribute15 -like *AgencyB*))}
```

This example creates the address list AL\_AgencyB that includes mailboxes that have the value of the CustomAttribute15 parameter set to AgencyB.

### Example 3 -------------------------- (Exchange Server 2013)
```
New-AddressList -Name "AL_AgencyB" -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'MailboxUser') -and (CustomAttribute15 -like *AgencyB*))}

This example creates the address list AL\_AgencyB that includes mailboxes that have the value of the CustomAttribute15 parameter contains AgencyB.

### Example 3 -------------------------- (Exchange Online)
```
New-AddressList -Name "AL_AgencyB" -RecipientFilter {((RecipientType -eq 'MailboxUser') -and (CustomAttribute15 -like *AgencyB*))}

!!! Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013

The ConditionalDepartment parameter is a filter to specify a department. All recipients with a department attribute that matches the value that you input for this parameter are included in the address list. You can use multiple values as a comma-delimited list. You can't use this parameter if you use the RecipientFilter parameter. You must use either the RecipientFilter parameter or one of these filter parameters:

- IncludedRecipients



!!! Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Online

The ConditionalDepartment parameter specifies a filter that's based on the value of the recipient's Department property. You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

When you use multiple values for this parameter, the OR Boolean operator is applied. For more information about how Conditional parameters work, see the Detailed Description section of this topic.

You can't use this parameter with the RecipientFilter parameter. You need to use the IncludedRecipients parameter with a Conditional parameter.

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
