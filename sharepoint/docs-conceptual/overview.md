## Overview ##

Microsoft PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that provides an administrator full access to applicable application programming interfaces (APIs). Administrators can interact directly with SharePoint Server to manipulate web applications, site collections, sites, lists and much more. In addition, an administrator can script cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets").

By default,  Powershell is located at the following path:  <%SystemRoot%>\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\PowerShell.exe.

For a list of SharePoint Server on-premises cmdlets, see [SharePoint Server cmdlets] (sharepoint-server-cmdlets.md)
