A repo to hold the help reference content for Office PowerShell cmdlets.

All edits to Markdown files for cmdlets MUST follow this schema: https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/blob/master/platyPS.schema.md
Any deviations will break Get-Help. To validate run the New-ExternalHelp command (from PlatyPS) on your Markdown.
